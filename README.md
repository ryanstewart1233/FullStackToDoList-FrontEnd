This is the front end for my full stack ToDoList App.

I built this app to Solidify the knowledge I had gained after I had learnt react and redux. This App uses Redux for state management, with enabled redux dev tools.

It uses axios for all API requests to the custom Back end I have build for this project (please see the other repo I have for the backend custom RESTful API I build for this project)

I have linked this app with google API services so that users can log in and their lists and corresponding todo items are stored under their user ID.
